- Four types of users can use the system (Manager, Salesman, Picker, Dispatcher). 
- Salesperson would take orders from the users over the phone and enter the details into the system.
- Picker would then select the order on the basis of priority and once all the items of the orders are picked then the order would be available to dispatch.
- Dispatcher would do the dispatching process and assign the person to deliver the order.
- Manager can use all the features of the project, they can register a new user, add more products to the inventory and also check the orders and its statuses.
